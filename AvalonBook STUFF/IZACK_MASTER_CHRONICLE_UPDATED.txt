IZACK MASTER CHRONICLE - UPDATED LORE INTEGRATION

1. POLLY’S ARRIVAL

It wasn’t a summoning. I didn’t chant her into existence or offer a pact. I was transcribing a spell that wouldn’t settle—runes slipped off the page like oil—and then I heard the rustle. Polly landed with such deliberate presence it startled me. She didn’t speak, not then. She simply scratched a correction into my notes with a rune-marked feather.

The moment didn’t feel arcane. It felt mutual. She had chosen me, not as a master, but as a translator. I believe she came from somewhere in between—drawn out of potential, not power.

Even now, she never says where she came from. But when I ask, she says: “Where boundaries blur, something always listens.” I think she means me. Or the robe. Or both.

2. WHEN I MET ARIA

Her magic smelled like citrus and ink—fresh, bright, encoded with memory. She caught the dimensional instability before I did, stabilized it with a boundary rune drawn across stone like calligraphy. It sang into place. No burn. No fracture.

I didn’t speak to her until after she left. Not out of fear, but because I was still trying to memorize the shape her spell left in the air.

I returned to that site days later and planted three World Tree seeds, aligned along the leyflow. It was the only language I trusted at the time. She visited again weeks later and said nothing—just knelt beside the saplings and drew a resonance circle. Our first ritual. Our first sentence.

3. TEACHING ZARA

Zara doesn’t take notes. She writes music into her spell matrix and hums contradiction into harmony. The first time I asked her to replicate a rune structure, she folded it—literally—and turned it inside out.

Polly hates it. Aria watches her closely. But I know what the robe means when it tightens around her: she is a glyph no one’s written before. Not a flaw—a question.

She once told me: “The spell either obeys or listens. I prefer the ones that listen.” I understood immediately.

4. MY SON, ALEXANDER

I’ve watched him dream in languages that haven’t been spoken yet. When he was born, the robe pulsed. When he touched the staff, it hummed—not with history, but with future resonance.

He doesn’t know it yet, but his mere presence writes prophecy. That’s dangerous. And beautiful.

I do not teach him the way I teach others. I let the magic respond to him first. If it chooses to reveal something, I guide him through it. But he speaks to magic like it’s a sibling. And it answers like one.

5. BECOMING A KING

I never sought a crown. I sought structure, a place where my ideas could unfold without apology.

But when Rupert placed the circlet on my brow, I realized I had already become something else: a keystone in a system I helped unlock.

Petty King. A title. But what I am—what I’m building—transcends it. Avalon is a question. A boundary. A contradiction. A memory. A door.

And I am its sentence.
