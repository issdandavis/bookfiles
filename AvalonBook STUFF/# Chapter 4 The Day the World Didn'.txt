# Chapter 4: The Day the World Didn't Move

*Time, I have learned, is less like a river and more like a cat—it goes where it pleases, stops when it wants to, and occasionally gets stuck in a tree. The trick is not to control it, but to scratch behind its ears until it purrs.*

Three months after the World Tree planted its first roots in consensus reality, I found Zara Millwright trying to fold time into origami cranes.

She sat in the manor's smallest library—the one that existed only on Wednesdays and alternating Thursdays—surrounded by paper birds that flickered in and out of temporal phase. Some were aged yellow with centuries that hadn't happened. Others gleamed fresh with tomorrows that might never arrive.

"It keeps slipping," she said without looking up. Her voice carried the particular frustration of someone whose magic insisted on interpreting rather than obeying. "Every time I think I've caught the right moment, it turns into something else."

I settled into a chair that solidified beneath me with resigned courtesy. "What moment are you trying to catch?"

"The one where I understand what I'm supposed to be." She gestured at the cranes, which took this as permission to rearrange themselves into patterns that hurt to perceive directly. "Dragonkin. Third Thread. Apprentice. I'm all these labels, but none of them quite fit."

Zara had arrived at Ravencrest six weeks ago, drawn by the World Tree's song and a letter from her grandmother that had been written in future tense. The dragon blood in her veins was diluted enough to be manageable, concentrated enough to be inconvenient. Magic pooled around her like water finding its level, but she couldn't quite cup her hands the right way to hold it.

"Show me," I said.

She held out her hand, palm up, and concentrated. The air above her skin shimmered, twisted, and then—

Time stuttered.

Not stopped, not slowed, but caught in a loop of indecision. The dust motes in the library's butter-thick light froze mid-dance, considered their options, then resumed their descent at angles that belonged to different moments. My heartbeat developed an echo, each pulse arriving before it left.

"That's... actually quite sophisticated," I managed, fighting the vertigo that came with experiencing temporal parallax.

"It's wrong," she insisted, letting the effect collapse. The cranes rustled with paper relief. "Everyone else's magic does what they tell it. Mine just makes suggestions and hopes I'll figure out what it means."

I thought about the Robes, which had never once done what I told them but always seemed to know what was needed. About Polly, who delighted in being helpful in the most frustrating ways possible. About the World Tree, growing according to its own understanding rather than our plans.

"Have you considered," I said carefully, "that your magic isn't disobedient? That perhaps it's trying to teach you something about the nature of time itself?"

"Time doesn't have a nature. It just is."

"Ah." I stood, decision crystallizing like morning frost. "Would you like to learn why that's both completely true and utterly wrong?"

Her eyes—dragon gold with human uncertainty—widened slightly. "You'd teach me? Properly?"

"Improperly, most likely. I've never had an apprentice before. But the World Tree's been whispering your name in languages that won't exist for centuries, so clearly someone thinks it's a good idea."

"The Tree talks to you?"

"Constantly. It's quite chatty for something without a mouth. Come on."

I led her through the manor's twisted geography to a room I'd been preparing without quite knowing why. The door opened onto a space that couldn't decide if it was workshop, library, or sanctuary, so had settled for being all three in overlapping succession.

"This is impossible," Zara breathed.

"Most of the best things are. Now, let's see about those labels you mentioned."

From a chest that existed in seventeen different states of locked and unlocked, I withdrew a set of apprentice robes. Not grand like mine, but woven from possibility's quieter threads—the soft gray of dawn-maybe, trimmed with silver that remembered being starlight.

"These are traditional," I lied cheerfully. "Every apprentice of dimensional magic has worn them."

"You just made that up."

"Yes, but I made it up truthfully. Put them on."

While she changed behind a screen that provided privacy across multiple timelines, I retrieved the amulet I'd been crafting. Carved from a moment of perfect stillness I'd found in the garden, strung on a chain forged from the space between heartbeats.

"The robes will help you focus," I explained when she emerged, looking somehow more herself in the impossible garment. "But this—" I held up the amulet "—this will help you remember that focus isn't always the point."

She took it reverently, and the moment it touched her skin, something shifted. The temporal distortions that had been leaking from her like steam suddenly condensed, became intentional rather than accidental.

"Oh," she said softly. "Oh, I see."

"What do you see?"

"The cranes. They weren't wrong. I was trying to fold time into shapes it already knew. But time doesn't want to be folded—it wants to dance."

As if to demonstrate, she raised her hand again. This time, the effect was entirely different. Time didn't stutter or loop—it waltzed. The dust motes traced spirals of past and future, the light through the windows painted shadows of yesterday across tomorrow's walls. And in the center of it all, Zara conducted with the confidence of someone who'd finally learned her magic's native language.

"Beautiful," I said, and meant it.

She let the dance fade, but the smile remained. "I still don't understand what I am."

"That's because you're still becoming it." I gestured to the room around us, to the World Tree visible through windows that showed it from angles that shouldn't exist. "None of us are finished. We're all rough drafts, constantly revising ourselves."

"Even you?"

"Especially me. Three months ago, I was a failed academic with delusions of theoretical grandeur. Now I'm... well, I'm not entirely sure, but it involves talking ravens and impossible trees and apparently taking on apprentices who fold time into origami."

She laughed, bright and sudden. "When you put it like that, it doesn't sound so strange that my magic has opinions."

"The best magic always does. Now, let's see what else those opinions might teach us."

We spent the rest of the day—if day was even the right word in a room where time moved like honey—exploring the edges of her ability. She couldn't stop time, couldn't reverse it, couldn't leap through it like some storybook chronomancer. But she could convince it to dance, to pause mid-step, to remember rhythms it had forgotten.

"You're not controlling time," I explained as she coaxed yesterday's rain to fall upward through today's window. "You're collaborating with it. Like a musicians in a duet where both players are improvising."

"But how do I know what notes to play?"

"You listen. And sometimes you play the wrong note, and that becomes part of the music too."

By the time the theoretical sun began its theoretical descent, Zara had progressed from temporal origami to temporal jazz. The cranes flew in circles that existed in six different moments simultaneously. The library hummed with the peculiar satisfaction of time well spent in multiple meanings of the phrase.

"Thank you," she said as we prepared to rejoin consensus reality. "For seeing what I could be instead of what I wasn't."

"Thank your grandmother. Her letter was very specific about the when of your arrival, if not the why."

"She does that. Sends letters from futures that might not happen, hoping someone will make them true." She paused at the door, one hand on the amulet. "Do you think that's what I'm supposed to learn? How to make uncertain futures certain?"

"I think," I said carefully, "you're supposed to learn that the best futures are the ones that remain a little uncertain. They're more interesting that way."

Outside the room, the manor's clocks all showed different times, as if they'd given up trying to agree on anything as mundane as the present moment. But Zara walked through the chronological chaos with new confidence, her robes whispering temporal secrets with every step.

"Same time tomorrow?" she asked.

"Define 'same' and 'tomorrow' in a place where both are suggestions."

She grinned. "Now you're learning."

As she left, trailing possibility like perfume, I felt the World Tree's approval like warm laughter in my chest. Another thread in the pattern, another note in the growing symphony of impossibility we were composing.

Polly appeared on my shoulder with her typical disregard for dramatic timing.

"An apprentice," she mused. "How delightfully traditional. Next you'll be growing a beard and speaking in cryptic riddles."

"The riddles come naturally. The beard refuses to cooperate across dimensional boundaries."

"Pity. You'd look distinguished. In a 'displaced academic pretending he knows what he's doing' sort of way."

"I prefer 'making it up as I go along with style.'"

"Yes, that's what I said."

Together we watched through the window as Zara practiced in the garden, teaching the flowers to bloom in yesterday's colors. The World Tree swayed in a breeze that belonged to no particular moment, its leaves whispering secrets in languages that would need centuries to finish inventing themselves.

Time moved forward, backward, and occasionally sideways.

But in that moment—that perfect, impossible, collaborative moment—it didn't move at all.

And that, I was beginning to understand, was exactly the point.

It's a dance partner with strong opinions about the music. The trick isn't to lead or follow, but to find the rhythm where both of you can shine."]*
