# Chapter 3: Of Gardens and Gateways

*The first rule of gardening in impossible places: the soil remembers what was planted before, even if it hasn't happened yet. The second rule: bring good gloves. Theoretical thorns hurt just as much as real ones.*

---

The Ravencrest gardens existed in a state of perpetual negotiation with reality. Paths wandered according to their own whims, fountains flowed upward when they felt like it, and the flowers bloomed in colors that required new forms of perception to properly appreciate.

"The secret," Aria explained as she led me deeper into the green impossibility, "is not to impose your will on the space, but to suggest possibilities and see which ones the garden finds amusing."

"The garden has a sense of humor?"

"Oh, decidedly. Last week it rearranged itself to spell out a rather ribald limerick about the groundskeeper. He's still blushing."

We passed beneath an archway of roses that grew in spirals through dimensions I couldn't name. Their thorns drew blood from angles that shouldn't exist, their petals fell upward like prayers ascending. The scent was memory made manifest—childhood summers that might have been, first loves that could still happen, last words that hadn't been spoken yet.

"Here," Aria said, stopping at a grove where the light fell differently, as if it had taken a detour through several realities before arriving. "This is where it wants to be."

The space hummed with anticipation. Not empty, but waiting—the way a stage waits for actors, the way a blank page waits for words. The soil here was darker than elsewhere, shot through with veins of starlight and root-memory.

I reached into my pocket and found the seed. Had it always been there? Had the Robes manifested it? Did it matter? It sat in my palm, heavier than its size suggested, warm with possibility.

"I don't know the proper rituals," I admitted.

"Good," Polly said, appearing on a branch I was certain hadn't existed moments before. "The improper ones are far more effective."

Aria knelt by the prepared earth, and after a moment's hesitation, I joined her. This close, I could see the faint tracery of magic that ran beneath her skin like illuminated text. Boundary magic, I realized—the art of defining where one thing ended and another began, of making edges that could cut or join with equal precision.

"My magic is about connections," I said, not sure why I was explaining. "About the spaces between things, the translations from one state to another."

"And mine is about borders." She smiled. "No wonder the universe finds us interesting. We're a paradox waiting to happen."

She began to trace symbols in the soil—not with her fingers but with intention itself, each gesture leaving trails of light that sank into the earth like instructions. I recognized some of them from theoretical texts, others from dreams I'd forgotten having. But there were new ones too, symbols that existed only in the space between her conception and my understanding.

"Together?" she asked, holding out her hand.

I took it. The moment our fingers intertwined, the magic changed. What had been two separate streams became a river, what had been harmony became symphony. I felt her precision merge with my intuition, her boundaries define my infinite spaces.

We planted the seed together, our joined hands placing it in soil that received it like a prophecy finally spoken aloud. The earth closed over it with a sound like satisfaction.

For a moment, nothing.

Then—

The world inhaled.

I felt it through the Robes, through the connection with Aria, through Polly's sudden stillness. Reality gathered itself, considered what we'd done, and made a decision.

The first shoot emerged like a green question mark, unfurling with deliberate grace. But this was no ordinary growth. The sapling climbed through dimensions as easily as air, its trunk a spiral of wood and starlight and mathematical certainty. Leaves budded and opened, each one a different shade of possibility.

"Oh," Aria breathed, and I felt her wonder echo through our joined hands. "Oh, it's beautiful."

It was. Beautiful and terrible and absolutely impossible. The World Tree—for what else could it be—grew not just upward but in directions that had no names. Its roots, I somehow knew, were already touching other realities. Its branches would eventually hold fruits that were answers to questions not yet asked.

"You did it," Polly said, and for once, her voice held no sarcasm. "You actually did it. Do you have any idea what you've just begun?"

"No," I said honestly.

"Good," said Count Eldrin, and neither Aria nor I startled at his sudden presence. In this moment, in this garden, everything was exactly where it should be. "The best beginnings are the ones we don't understand. Gives them room to become more than we imagined."

He stood at the edge of the grove, watching the World Tree's impossible growth with the satisfaction of a man whose wildest theories had just been proven inadequate.

"It will need tending," he continued. "Trees that grow in multiple realities require careful pruning. Too much growth in one dimension, and the whole thing becomes lopsided. Metaphysically speaking."

"We'll tend it," Aria said, and I noticed she hadn't let go of my hand.

"We?" I asked.

She looked at me, and in her eyes I saw reflections of futures spreading out like branches. "Did you think this was a one-person job? The Tree knows better. It's already writing us into its roots."

"Collaborative magic," the Count mused. "How refreshingly old-fashioned. And how desperately needed. The age of solitary sorcerers ended when the Third Archive burned. Or will burn. I really must get better at temporal grammar."

The World Tree pulsed with gentle light, and I felt something settle into place—not just in the garden, not just in the moment, but in the fundamental structure of what was possible. A door had opened that couldn't be closed, a story had begun that demanded telling.

"There will be consequences," the Count warned, but his smile suggested he found the prospect delightful. "Trees like this don't grow in secret. Every reality it touches will know something has changed. Some will come seeking wisdom. Others..." He shrugged eloquently.

"Let them come," I said, surprising myself with the certainty in my voice. "The Tree will be ready."

"Will we?" Aria asked.

I squeezed her hand gently. "I suppose we'll find out together."

Polly laughed, bright and sharp as breaking glass. "Oh, this is going to be magnificent. Catastrophic, probably. Possibly apocalyptic. But definitely magnificent."

The sun—the theoretical one that had opinions about everything—chose that moment to set in several directions at once, painting the garden in shades of maybe and might-be. The World Tree cast shadows that fell across dimensions, and in those shadows, I glimpsed the shape of things to come.

A school that taught impossible things.
A realm that existed in the spaces between.
Children who would speak in languages not yet invented.
And at the center of it all, two fools who'd planted a seed without fully understanding what would grow.

"Dinner," the Count announced, as if we hadn't just fundamentally altered the nature of local reality. "I believe Cook has prepared something that exists in only three dimensions. Practically pedestrian by current standards, but sometimes simple is best."

As we walked back toward the manor, the World Tree sang its first song—wordless but wonderful, a melody that would work its way into the dreams of everyone who heard it. Some would wake with tears on their faces. Others with equations on their tongues.

All would know, in that bone-deep way that bypasses conscious thought, that something had begun.

"That was well done," Aria said quietly as we walked. "The planting, I mean. Very intuitive."

"I had excellent help."

"Flatterer." But she smiled. "Father's right, you know. This is just the beginning. The Tree will grow, and as it grows, it will change things. The question is: are we ready for what we've started?"

I thought about the cave where I'd woken, about Polly's cryptic warnings, about the Robes that whispered secrets in languages I was only beginning to understand.

"No," I said. "But I don't think that's the point. I think the point is to grow along with it. To let it change us as we tend it."

"Collaborative evolution," she murmured. "I like that."

Behind us, the World Tree settled into its new existence with the patience of something that measured time in centuries. Its roots dug deep into soil that existed in seventeen dimensions. Its branches reached toward stars that hadn't been born yet.

And in its heartwood, barely visible to eyes that knew how to look, two names were already beginning to inscribe themselves in the grammar of growth.

Not because we'd earned it.

But because the Tree, like all wise growing things, knew that sometimes the best gardeners were the ones who planted seeds in ignorance and tended them w
