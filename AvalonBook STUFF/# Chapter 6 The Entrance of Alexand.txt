# Chapter 6: The Entrance of Alexander

*Some arrivals are heralded by trumpets and ceremony. Others slip in through cracks in the conversation, changing everything while pretending to change nothing. Alexander Danvovik-Elensar announced himself through dreams that tasted of tomorrow and a subtle shift in how magic moved through the world.*

Aria told me she was pregnant on a morning when the light fell through Avalon's windows like honey through time, each beam carrying its own small eternity. She didn't make a production of it—that wasn't her way. She simply looked up from her tea, met my eyes with that particular combination of certainty and wonder that meant she'd discovered something worth sharing, and said:

"I'm carrying our child."

The words rearranged reality.

Not dramatically—no thunder crashed, no mystical winds arose. But I felt the shift in my bones, in the Robes that suddenly hummed with frequencies I'd never heard before, in the way Polly went absolutely still on her perch by the window.

"That's..." I began, then stopped, because no words seemed adequate to the magnitude of the moment.

"Impossible?" Aria suggested, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. "We do specialize in that."

"I was going to say wonderful." I moved around the table to kneel beside her chair, taking her hands in mine. They trembled slightly—the only sign that her calm was carefully maintained. "How long have you known?"

"Since yesterday. The roses told me."

Of course they had. The theoretical roses in her father's garden had developed opinions about everything, and apparently that now included reproductive prophecy.

"But there's something else," she continued, and here her voice carried the particular tone of someone delivering news that would require significant processing. "I can feel the child's magic. Already. That's not supposed to happen for months, sometimes not until after birth."

I extended my senses carefully, the way one might reach toward a butterfly without wanting to startle it into flight. And there it was—a presence so small it barely registered, yet undeniably real. Magic that felt like both of ours but also entirely its own, as if our collaborative workings had created not just spells but a entirely new form of existence.

"Oh," I breathed, understanding flooding through me. "Oh, that's—"

"Concerning?" Polly interjected, abandoning her pretense of disinterest to hop closer. "Because that's the word I'd use for a pregnancy that's already bending local thaumic fields."

"I was going to say miraculous."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive." She fixed me with one dark eye. "Have you considered what this means? A child conceived in Avalon, where reality is more suggestion than law? Born to parents who practice collaborative magic that shouldn't exist? Growing in a womb that's hosted boundary workings that make most archmages nervous?"

"When you put it like that—"

"It sounds like we're about to raise something unprecedented," Aria finished calmly. "Yes. We know."

Her hand moved to rest on her still-flat stomach, and I covered it with my own. Through our joined touch, I felt the child's magic pulse—curious, already reaching out to explore its boundaries, already testing what was possible.

"We should tell your father," I said.

"He already knows." Her smile turned wry. "He's been watching the temporal currents shift for weeks. He's... pleased. And planning. You know how he gets when the universe confirms one of his theories."

I did indeed. Count Eldrin's particular combination of cosmic awareness and paternal pride would make for interesting family dinners.

"There's a political dimension too," Aria added, because of course there was. "The child of the Ravencrest heir and the founder of Avalon Academy. Born into a realm that exists between dimensions. Some will see it as an opportunity."

"And others as a threat."

"Those too."

We sat in silence for a moment, hands linked, feeling the subtle shift in how magic moved between us. Our collaborative casting had always been strong, but now it carried an extra dimension—not just two streams joining but three, though the third was still more potential than presence.

"The child is dreaming," Aria said softly. "I can feel it. Dreams in colors that don't exist yet, in languages that haven't been invented. What kind of person dreams before they're even properly formed?"

"Our kind, apparently."

Polly laughed, sharp and bright. "Oh, this is going to be magnificently complicated. Do you have any idea what you've done? You've created not just a child but a nexus. A living bridge between different forms of magic, different ways of being. The universe is going to have opinions about this."

"Let it," I said with more confidence than I felt. "We've gotten good at dealing with universal opinions."

The morning light shifted, and for a moment I could swear I saw the shadow of who our child would become—tall and thoughtful, with Aria's determined grace and my tendency toward impossible questions. But the vision faded before I could grasp details, leaving only the impression of someone who would change things simply by existing.

"We'll need to adjust the Academy," Aria said, already thinking practically. "Children of faculty and students will become more common as Avalon grows. We should plan for that. Nurseries that exist in stable timestreams. Playgrounds where young magic can express itself safely."

"Safely being a relative term in a realm where the architecture has opinions."

"Exactly."

That afternoon, Count Eldrin arrived with the inevitability of a well-predicted theorem. He took one look at us and smiled with the satisfaction of someone whose calculations had proven correct.

"A grandchild," he said, as if tasting the word. "How delightfully destabilizing. I assume you've noticed the temporal resonances?"

"The what now?" I asked.

"The child exists slightly outside standard chronology. Nothing dramatic—a few seconds here and there. But enough to suggest that time moves differently for them. Or perhaps more accurately, they move differently through time."

"That's..." I paused, trying to process the implications.

"A family trait," Aria said dryly. "Father experiences time as more of a suggestion than most. It seems the baby inherited that."

"Among other things." The Count's expression grew more serious. "This child—your child—represents something new. Not just politically, though there will be those who see an heir to both Ravencrest mysteries and Avalon innovation as either opportunity or threat. But magically, philosophically... this is a child who will grow up believing that collaborative impossibility is normal. Who will see boundaries as things to be danced with rather than enforced. Do you understand what that means?"

"That we're about to become parents to someone who will find our impossible achievements quaint and probably improve on them before they're ten?"

"Essentially, yes."

That evening, as word spread through Avalon (because keeping secrets in a community of mages was like trying to contain light in a soap bubble), our extended family of faculty and advanced students gathered to celebrate. Toasts were raised with wine that sparkled with blessing. Zara performed a temporal melody that would ensure the baby experienced only pleasant dreams. The constructs began carving toys that would grow with the child's understanding.

"To the next generation," someone called out, "may they surpass us in every way!"

"To Alexander or Alexandra," Aria added, "whose name we know though they're barely more than possibility!"

I started. "You know the name?"

"Don't you?" She smiled. "Close your eyes and listen. The child is already telling us, in that space between dream and certainty."

I did, and there it was—clear as bell-song in winter air. Alexander. A name that meant 'defender,' but more than that, a name that felt like bridges being built between impossibilities.

"Alexander," I repeated, and felt the rightness of it settle into my bones.

That night, as Avalon settled into its dreaming routines and the World Tree hummed lullabies that wouldn't be written for years yet, Aria and I lay together, hands joined over the promise of new life.

"Are you frightened?" she asked.

"Terrified," I admitted. "We're about to raise a child in a realm where physics is optional and the walls occasionally rearrange themselves for better feng shui."

"We're about to raise a child who will think that's normal," she corrected. "Who will grow up surrounded by love that transcends species and magic that rewards cooperation over dominance. Whatever else happens, that foundation will hold."

Outside our window, the first stars were emerging—not in their usual configurations but spelling out blessing in languages only children not yet born would fully understand. The universe, it seemed, was already preparing itself for Alexander's arrival.

"Nine months," I murmured. "Nine months to make Avalon ready for someone who's already rewriting reality just by existing."

"Eight months," Aria corrected. "Apparently temporal displacement affects gestation too."

Polly, who had been suspiciously quiet from her perch on the headboard, finally spoke: "You realize this is just the beginning? First comes one child who dreams in impossible colors. Then others will follow. Avalon isn't just a school—it's becoming a new way of being human. Or elven. Or whatever species decides that collaborative evolution sounds appealing."

She was right, of course. In choosing to build something unprecedented, we'd created not just an academy but a future. And now that future had a name and a heartbeat and dreams that tasted of tomorrow.

"Let them come," I said softly. "Let all the impossible children come and learn that their impossibility is not a flaw but a gift."

The Robes pulsed with warm approval, and somewhere in the space between dream and waking, I felt Alexander's magic pulse in response—already curious, already reaching out to understand this strange and wonderful world he would soon inhabit.

The entrance had begun. Everything that followed would be shaped by this moment when two people who specialized in impossible things created the most impossible thing of all: new life that would redefine what life itself could mean.

The emotional implications are beyond calculation. Note to self: Begin crafting toys that exist in stable timeloops. The child will need playthings that can keep up with their nature."]*
