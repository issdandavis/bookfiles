# Chapter 5: A Place Called Avalon

*There are births that happen in blood and screaming, and births that happen in silence and starlight. The birth of Avalon was neither and both—a realm singing itself into existence while those of us who thought we were its creators discovered we were merely midwives to something that had been waiting to exist.*

"It needs a name," Aria said, standing at the edge of what wasn't yet anything—just potential wrapped in morning mist and the World Tree's patient breathing.

We'd been circling the question for days. The Tree had grown beyond all reasonable expectation, its canopy now hosting conversations between clouds and its roots drinking from streams that flowed upward when they felt philosophical. Around its base, reality had grown soft and malleable, like clay warmed by cosmic hands.

"Names have power," I replied, which was both true and a spectacular avoidance of the actual question.

"Everything has power." Polly landed between us with her typical disregard for dramatic gravity. "The question is whether we're naming what is or what will be."

The space—for it wasn't yet a place—shimmered with indecision. One moment it looked like rolling meadows painted by an artist who'd never seen limitations. The next, crystal spires twisted through dimensions I couldn't name. It was trying on possibilities like garments, seeing what fit.

"Avalon," Aria said suddenly, then looked surprised at herself. "I don't know why, but—"

"The isle of apples," I murmured, memory stirring like sediment in still water. "Where the wounded king goes to heal. Where magic retreats when the world grows too cynical for wonder."

"Pretty heavy symbolism for a school," Polly observed.

"Who said anything about a school?"

But even as I spoke, I could feel the wrongness of the denial. The Robes rustled with amused certainty, and the space around us took on a quality of patient expectation, like an empty classroom waiting for its first lesson.

"Oh," I said, understanding arriving with its usual lack of warning. "Oh, we're really doing this."

"Doing what, exactly?" Aria asked, though her smile suggested she already knew.

"Building something impossible. A place where magic isn't just studied but lived. Where beings from different realities can learn not just spells but understanding." I gestured at the shimmer of potential around us. "A school that teaches what no one knows how to teach—collaboration across impossibility."

The moment the words left my mouth, the space made its decision.

Reality crystallized like frost on window glass, patterns spreading from where we stood in spirals of architectural impossibility. Ground that had been suggestion became stone that remembered being stardust. Sky that had been theory became air that knew how to hold dragons and dreams with equal grace.

And at the center, rising like an answered question, the Spiral Spire began its ascent.

It didn't build itself so much as remember that it had always existed. Stone flowed like water finding its level, crystallizing into walls that were also windows into other whens. Stairs spiraled both up and down from every landing, leading to classrooms that existed in seventeen different states of possibility.

"That's showing off," Polly commented as a particularly ambitious buttress decided to support itself through sheer audacity.

But she was smiling—I could hear it in her voice—as the Academy wrote itself into existence around us. Libraries bloomed like flowers, their shelves eager for books not yet written. Laboratories crystallized from pure curiosity, beakers and alembics already humming with experiments waiting to go wonderfully wrong. Gardens terraced themselves into hillsides that hadn't existed moments before, ready for seeds that would grow into questions.

"We'll need dormitories," Aria said, her practical nature asserting itself even in the face of architectural miracle. "Kitchens. Halls for gathering. Places for solitude and places for community."

As she spoke, Avalon listened. Buildings rose like responses to unasked questions, connected by paths that understood sometimes the longest distance between two points was the most educational. A great hall materialized with acoustics designed for both lectures and laughter. Towers sprouted for those who needed height to think. Underground chambers carved themselves for those who found wisdom in depth.

"It's too much," I said, suddenly overwhelmed by the scale of what we'd begun. "How do we run something this vast? How do we teach what we barely understand ourselves?"

"The same way we do everything else," Aria said, taking my hand with the casual certainty that had become our foundation. "Together, imperfectly, and with help."

As if summoned by her words, they began to arrive.

First came the constructs—not built but born from Avalon's need for caretakers. Beings of living stone and helpful intention, already busy maintaining gardens that didn't yet have flowers. Then the spirits—wisps of curiosity given just enough form to carry messages and mend what needed mending.

"The infrastructure builds itself," I marveled, watching a construct carefully adjust a sundial to account for the non-standard behavior of local light.

"No," Polly corrected. "The infrastructure builds what's needed. There's a difference."

She took wing, circling the Spire in a spiral that matched its architecture. Where her shadow passed, details emerged—weather vanes that pointed to possibility rather than direction, windows that opened onto different seasons depending on the viewer's need, doors that led wherever someone most needed to go.

"She's conducting," Aria realized. "Helping it understand what we need."

"What we need," I said slowly, "is help."

The Robes pulsed with warm approval, and I felt a gathering in the fabric of space around us. Not students—not yet—but those who understood what we were building and wanted to be part of its foundation.

They came through the gaps between moments, drawn by the World Tree's song and Avalon's promise. A few at first—scholars who'd grown tired of universities that taught only what was already known, mages whose power had always been collaborative but who'd never found partners, beings from distant realities who understood that education meant more than the accumulation of facts.

"Welcome," I found myself saying to each arrival, the words feeling like ritual. "Welcome to Avalon, where we learn by teaching and teach by learning."

"Bit pretentious," Polly stage-whispered as she landed on my shoulder.

"Bit true," I whispered back.

By sunset—or what passed for sunset in a realm that was still negotiating its relationship with linear time—Avalon had become not just a place but a community. The Spire reached toward stars that had rearranged themselves to spell out mathematical theorems. Gardens bloomed with flowers that grew in colors only visible to those who needed to see them. And in the great hall, two dozen beings from nine different realities shared a meal that somehow satisfied everyone despite the radical differences in their digestive philosophies.

"A toast," Aria proposed, raising a cup that contained something between wine and liquid starlight. "To Avalon, may it always be more than we intended and exactly what's needed."

"To impossible architecture and improbable faculty," I added.

"To students we haven't met yet and lessons we don't know how to teach," someone called from the far end of the table.

"To making it up as we go along!" Polly cawed, and everyone laughed.

Outside, the World Tree sang its approval in harmonies that made the Spire resonate like a tuning fork struck by joy. Reality settled into its new configuration with the satisfaction of an equation finally balanced.

Avalon existed. Not complete—it would never be complete, always growing, always becoming—but real. A place where magic could be studied not as power to be hoarded but as connection to be shared.

"Tomorrow we start planning curriculum," Aria said as we walked through halls that still smelled of possibility and fresh paint.

"Tonight," I corrected, "we appreciate what we've built."

"What's been built through us," she amended.

"That too."

Polly flew ahead, her laughter echoing through corridors that multiplied it into a symphony of mirth. Constructs paused in their work to listen. Spirits danced in her wake. And somewhere in the depths of the Academy, I could swear I heard the building itself chuckling.

We'd built a school. Or perhaps a school had built itself around our intention. Either way, Avalon was born, and with it, the promise of education that transcended dimension, species, and the limited imagination of those who thought magic was about power rather than connection.

The first day of classes would bring its own chaos. But tonight, in this moment between creation and purpose, everything was exactly as impossible as it needed to be.
